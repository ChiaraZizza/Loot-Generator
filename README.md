# Loot-Generator

Description: This code uses mapping structures to implement the loot generation algorithm found in Diablo II. It was written using Java.

To generate a single piece of loot, the program goes through the following steps:

1.) Randomly picks a monster to fight and beat.

2.) Looks up the treasure class of that particular monster and using that treasure class, generates the base item that is dropped by the monster.

3.) Generates the base stats for the generated base item.

4.) Generates affixes (i.e., prefixes and suffixes) for the item and stat modifiers from those affixes.
